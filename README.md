# gpx_waypoints_to_geocache
 Goal:   The goal of this script is to convert waypoints into geocaches.
         There is a long hiking track in hungary called the "Kék túra"
         There are checkpoints on this track wich are published on http://kektura.hu/szakaszok.html
         This sript will convert waypoints into Geocaches, so you can use your
         Geocaching device to help you to navigate to these checkpoints
 Input:  gpx file with waypoints
         Source is: http://kektura.hu/assets/okt_teljes_belyegzohellyel_gpx_2019-09-11.gpx
 Output: gpx file with waypoints converted to geocaches
         I have loaded the gpx file into BaseCamp and moved to my Garming eTrex device
